This project is an automation testing framework designed to test web applications using the Selenium Webdriver tool and also testNG framework to make automated tests more structured, readable, maintainable, and user-friendly. 
The testcases are, 
1. Verify User Can Search with Partial Text.
  #Expected result : Verify user can see a list of predicted users that has "ch" in their names (ignore case/not case sensitive), And the system will display results of records found - from there verify that at least the first 3 should have ch in either First or Last name column
2. Verify User Can Add Pay Grades.
  #Expected result : Verify user can observe the added records in the Currencies section.
